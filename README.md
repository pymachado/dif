DIF (Decentralized Invoice Factoring) based on Blockchain

This is a Blockchain Protocol based on Solidity language that use OpenZeppelin libraries to do efficiently, secure and functionally it. 
The Protocol implementation declare a factoring system based on blockchain, and use a Pool, manage by the owner or a DAO.  
This Pool, allow a fast investing on differents Sales Contracts that have associated one token erc721 to will sell. 
The Protocol use a Role Based Access Control to do secure transactions, defining roles for each users. 

The Protocolo is compound for 3 main Smart Contracts:

    TokenFactoring.sol 
    hash tx : 0x07bce5b30c96245a235bf9dd46793135cf7d0a94ee913c15dcd0c6ed848d71da
    contract address: 
    0xBb4e5208B88F68CE12Afa38403246D9c3D790020
    Sale.sol
    PoolRBAC.sol
    hash tx: 
    0xc6e53751d3a228827d5ddae703c1e937403260eb467ccfa1f184da6df0f4c28c
    contract address: 
    0x217b3e06482F0e0Eb94dC94aDC2025A1aD40D266
  
Each contract define a set of function to do and together done a system.
