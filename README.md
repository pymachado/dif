This Pool, allow a fast investing on differents Sales Contracts that have associated one token erc721 to will sell. 
The Protocol use a Role Based Access Control to do secure transactions, defining roles for each users. 

The Protocolo is compound for 3 main Smart Contracts:

    TokenFactoring.sol

    PoolRBAC.sol
  
Each contract define a set of function to do and together done a system.
